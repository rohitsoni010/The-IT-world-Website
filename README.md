Problem Statement
You must have visited various websites which gives you information about technology
but there is no such site which let you give your own ideas and help shape the future of
technology. Mostly, people have ideas in there mind, but due to lack of resources such
as time and money they may never work on it. And there is no such site which let you
share your ideas and later on give you credit when the idea is successfully converted into
technology.
1.2 Project Objectives
 Create a website especially for Technology and its future.
On our website, we’ll let people share their own ideas and also some problems
related to their daily life which may be solved by someone else from the audience
of our website.
All the ideas you will provide will be secured with us in your name and our technical
team will work on it.
All the daily life problems you provide will be published on our site in your name
so that someone in the audience may provide an idea to solve it.
1.3 Project Scope
The scope of this project is very wide. In today’s world, there are two types of people,
one who use technology and the other who create or develop it. From the user point
of view, this website will give them a platform to share their problems in the current
technology. And from the developer point of view, who themselves are also users, this
website will create a platform to share their ideas in the world.
1.4 Goals
Our goal is to make this website a benchmark in the world where people will come and
share their views, ideas and problems, and the other audience will work and solve the
problems. Also this website designed in India will provide the information related to
technology in India.
